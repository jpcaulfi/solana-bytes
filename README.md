# solana-bytes
Byte-sized videos for learning Solana development

Test YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcP7lAKS6XOL_cczIfEqcHQ


> Most of the examples in the demo (creating accounts, transfers, tokens, NFTs, etc.) can all be done via `web3.js` without the need for a custom program. We could possibly have a byte video for each demo; dubbed something like:
> - Solana Bytes - Create an Account (On-Chain)
> - Solana Bytes - Create an Account (Client)
